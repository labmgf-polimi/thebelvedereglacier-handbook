# 3D Viewer

The 3D viewer is the web-based tool that allows every user, also without a technical background in geomatics, to explore pointcluds and target time series from the annual monitoring campaigns.

The platform, based on the combined adoption of [Potree](https://github.com/potree/potree), [Cesium](https://cesium.com/) and [Echarts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) JS libraries, not only deploy on the web pointclouds through WebGL technologies, but also enable the temporal exploration of them, integrating native Potree functionalities with custom features in support to user-friendly navigation.

For a better and stable experience, we highly recommend the usage of Google Chrome for best performances on the web.
