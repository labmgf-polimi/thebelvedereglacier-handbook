# Website

**The Belvedere Glacier** website offers information on the monitoring and study of the debris-covered Belvedere Glacier in the Italian Alps. It provides access to open geodata, including point clouds, digital surface models, and orthophotos from 1977-2023, along with GNSS measurement data. Users can explore a 3D viewer of the glacier and learn about the annual summer school program organized by the Politecnico di Milano.

The website is the starting point to get to know more interactively about the Belvedere glacier conditions over time. You can find 4 main sections:

- **3D Viewer**

- **Open geodata**

- **Measurement data**

- **Summer School**

Each of the sections

## 3D Viewer

The tool, based on open source libraries, allows for easy and interactive exploration of 3D products, in particular point clouds, in space and time. Indeed, it provides a 3D viewer for evaluating high-resolution point cloud data of the Belvedere Glacier. Users can select different survey years and overlay GNSS measurement data to analyze glacier changes over time.

## Open Geodata

This Zenodo record contains a comprehensive open dataset for monitoring the Belvedere Glacier, including photogrammetric point clouds, orthophotos, and DEMs from 1977 to 2023. It was created utilizing UAV and aerial images to track glacier changes. The data is organized by year and is suited for glacier dynamics studies, such as volume changes and moraine processes.

## Measurement data

This page provides an interactive 2D web map for exploring Belvedere Glacier geospatial data. Users can view digital surface models and orthophotos as WMS, overlaying on them GNSS target measurements over various years to analyze glacier evolution.

## Summer School

This section describes the annual Belvedere Glacier Summer School, organized by Politecnico di Milano. The program is designed for students, researchers, and professionals interested in glacier monitoring techniques, covering fieldwork and data analysis related to glaciology and geomatics. Participants gain hands-on experience using advanced tools to study glacier dynamics and environmental changes. The Learning Resources are released online to enhance open geo-education.
