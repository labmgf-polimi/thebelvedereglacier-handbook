# Website

**The Belvedere Glacier** website offers information on the monitoring and study of the debris-covered Belvedere Glacier in the Italian Alps. It provides access to open geodata, including point clouds, digital surface models, and orthophotos from 1977-2023, along with GNSS measurement data. Users can explore a 3D viewer of the glacier and learn about the annual summer school program organized by the Politecnico di Milano.
